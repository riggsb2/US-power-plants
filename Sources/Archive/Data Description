Copied from the EIA website, below describes the dataset used in this analysis. https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/

The survey Form EIA-923 collects detailed electric power data -- monthly and annually -- on electricity generation, fuel consumption,
fossil fuel stocks, and receipts at the power plant and prime mover level. Specific survey information provided:

Schedule 2 - fuel receipts and costs
Schedules 3A & 5A - generator data including generation, fuel consumption and stocks
Schedule 4 - fossil fuel stocks
Schedules 6 & 7 - non-utility source and disposition of electricity
Schedules 8A-F - environmental data
Monthly data (M) - over 1,800 plants from the monthly survey
Annual final data - approximately 1,900 monthly plants + 4,100 plants from the annual survey
Annual early release data (ER) NOTE: data not yet validated - includes approximately 2,250 monthly plants + 5,250 plants from the annual
survey. A small number of plants are excluded pending data validation.

The EIA-906, EIA-920, EIA-923 and predecessor forms provide monthly and annual data on generation and fuel consumption at the power plant
and prime mover level. A subset of plants, steam-electric plants 10 MW and above, also provides boiler level and generator level data. Data 
for utility plants are available from 1970, and for nonutility plants from 1999. Beginning with January 2004 data collection, the EIA-920 
was used to collect data from the combined heat and power plant (cogeneration) segment of the nonutility sector; also as of 2004, 
nonutilities filed the annual data for nonutility source and disposition of electricity. Beginning in 2007, environmental data was 
collected on Schedules 8A – 8F of the Form 923 and includes by-product disposition, financial information, NOX control operations, cooling
system operations and FGP and FGD unit operations. Beginning in 2008, the EIA-923 superseded the EIA-906, EIA-920, FERC 423, and the EIA-
423. Schedule 2 of the EIA-923 collects the plant level fuel receipts and cost data previously collected on the FERC and EIA Forms 423.
Fuel receipts and costs data prior to 2008.

Power plant data prior to 2001 are separate files for utility and nonutility plants. For 2001 data and subsequent years, the data are Excel
spreadsheet files that include data for all plants and make other changes to the presentation of the data.

The Form EIA 906/920 data for 2004-2006 were updated. A new method of allocating fuel consumption between electric power generation and 
useful thermal output (UTO) was implemented for 2004-2008. This new methodology proportionally distributes a combined heat and power (CHP)
plant’s losses between the two output products (electric power and UTO). In the historical data, UTO was consistently assumed to be 80 
percent efficient and all other losses at the plant were allocated to electric power. This change results in the fuel for electric power to
be lower, while the fuel for UTO is higher than the prior set of data as both are given the same efficiency. This results in the appearance 
of an increase in efficiency of production of electric power between 2003 and 2004. The same methodology is applied to final 2007 and 
preliminary 2008 data. More information about the methodology can be found in the Appendix C, Technical Notes, to the Electric Power 
Monthly
