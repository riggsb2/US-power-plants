The proposed work aims to evaluate power plant technology within the US. EIA reporting provides a plethora of information regarding plant generator type, types of fuel, total fuel consumption, electricity generated, etc. back to 1970. With the current, and undoubtedly future, focus on energy technology, understanding the performance and costs of established plants is critical to make informed decisions concerning future policy and research and development. The project aims to look at a variety of metrics including plant efficiency over time sorted by generator type, fuel type portfolio development and correlation to elecitricity price, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs over time and correlation to maintaining performance, and correlation to retail and wholesale electricity prices. Because of the large societal footprint power plants have, further development beyond the initial project could also look at health statistics, economic effects, and environmental considerations in the surround areas.

My name is Brian Riggs and I'm currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher in Renewable Energy at Tulane University. The energy landscape is constantly changing in order to keep up with our societies demands for more power, high levels of reliability, at a reasonable cost. Examining past and current performance of US power generation can help discover critical information to aid in policy, infrastructure, and R&D efforts within the energy sector. The EIA power plant annual report can help us determine if a technology has shown growth over the past 40 years, if electricity prices are correlated to performance, and how the generator type portfolio has shifts and potentially offering insight for future infrastructure and technologicalinvestment.
